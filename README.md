<p align="center">
Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,
<br>
The Lord knoweth them that are his.
<br>
And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
<br>
<br>
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,
<br>
but also of wood and of earth;
<br>
and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
<br>
<br>
If a man therefore purge himself from these,
<br>
he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified,
<br>
and meet for the master's use,
<br>
and prepared unto every good work.
<br>
<strong>2 Timothy 2:19-21</strong>
